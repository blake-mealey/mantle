## Config file resolving

All Mantle commands accept a `PROJECT` argument which tells Mantle where to look for your config file.
Mantle uses the following rules to find your config file:

1. If the `PROJECT` argument was _not provided_, use the `mantle.yml` file in the current directory as the
   config file (if it exists).
2. If the `PROJECT` argument was _a directory_, use the `mantle.yml` file in that directory as
   the config file (if it exists).
3. If the `PROJECT` argument was _a file_, use it as the config file (if it exists).

If no config file is found, Mantle will exit with an error code.

## File path resolving

Many Mantle config properties require file paths or globs. All file paths should be written relative to the
config file's directory.

For example, with the directory structure:

```txt
.
╰── project/
    ├── mantle.yml
    ├── game.rbxlx
    ╰── marketing/
        ├── game-icon.png
        ├── thumbnail-1.png
        ╰── thumbnail-2.png
```

You would use the config:

```yml title="project/mantle.yml"
target:
  experience:
    configuration:
      icon: marketing/game-icon.png
      thumbnails:
        - marketing/thumbnail-1.png
        - marketing/thumbnail-2.png
    places:
      start:
        file: game.rbxlx
```

Mantle will correctly find the referenced files no matter where you execute Mantle from.

## YAML syntax

Mantle config files use YAML syntax, and should have either a `.yml` or `.yaml` file extension. To
quickly get started with the YAML syntax, see "[Learn YAML in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/yaml/)"
or read through the examples in this guide and in the [Examples](https://github.com/blake-mealey/mantle-examples)
repo.

## Schema

You can view the JSON schema for the config file in the [Releases](https://github.com/blake-mealey/mantle/releases)
assets (only for versions above `0.11.0`). You can also use the schema to add autocomplete to your editor. For
VSCode, you can install the [YAML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml) extension
and add the following to your VSCode settings:

```json
"yaml.schemas": {
   "https://mantledeploy.vercel.app/schemas/{{ schemaVersion }}/schema.json": "mantle.yml"
}
```

Now you should see autocomplete suggestions and documentation while editing your `mantle.yml` config files.
