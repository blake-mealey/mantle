# Authentication

## Resource management

To manage resources, Mantle requires a valid `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie value to authenticate all its
requests.

If there is a logged-in Roblox Studio installation, Mantle can automatically
extract its `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie and will authenticate requests as the user
logged in to Roblox Studio.

Otherwise, you will have to provide the cookie via an environment variable called `ROBLOSECURITY`.

You can set your environment variable in various ways, like the following:

<Tabs items={["dotenv file", "Windows (PowerShell)", "MacOS/Linux (Bash)"]}>
    <Tab>
        Create a `.env` file with the contents:

        ```shell
        ROBLOSECURITY="{your cookie}"
        ```

        [Learn more →](#dotenv-files)
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```ps1
        $env:ROBLOSECURITY = "{your cookie}"
        ```

        Note that this will be temporary and you will have to reset it whenever you start a new terminal
        instance.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        export ROBLOSECURITY = "{your cookie}"
        ```

        Note that this will be temporary and you will have to reset it whenever you start a new terminal
        instance.
    </Tab>

</Tabs>

To get your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie manually, you have a few options:

<Tabs items={["From Browser Dev Tools", "With rbx_cookie utility", "From Roblox Studio (Windows)", "From Roblox Studio (MacOS)"]}>
    <Tab>
        Navigate to [roblox.com](https://www.roblox.com) in your browser and open the dev tools (right-click
        and select "Inspect"). Navigate to the "Application" tab, then look for "Cookies" under "Storage" in
        the left-hand sidebar. Under "Cookies", select "`https://www.roblox.com`" then select
        "`.ROBLOSECURITY`" from the list of cookies. Copy the value from the "Cookie Value" section. You can
        then set your environment variable using one of the above methods.

        Note that if you ever log out of your browser session the cookie will be revoked and anything using it
        will no longer work. Getting a cookie from a Roblox Studio session is less likely to get revoked as you
        typically log out of Roblox Studio less often.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        The [`rbx_cookie`](https://crates.io/crates/rbx_cookie) utility is the same tool that Mantle uses to find the
        cookie from the logged-in Roblox Studio installation. To install it, first ensure you have Rust installed,
        then run `cargo install rbx_cookie`. Now just run `rbx_cookie` in your terminal to access your cookie.

        You can also use the [`rbx_auth`](https://crates.io/crates/rbx_auth) utility to check which user is currently
        logged-in to Roblox Studio. Install it with `cargo install rbx_auth` and run `rbx_auth` in your terminal to
        check the logged-in user.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        Open the Start Menu and search for `regedit` and hit enter. In the window that opens, navigate to
        `Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Roblox\RobloxStudioBrowser\roblox.com\`. Double-click on
        `.ROBLOSECURITY` to open its value, then look for the text in the format `COOK::<value>`. Copy the
        `value` part (not including the `<`/`>`). This is your `.ROBLOSECURITY` cookie. You can then set
        your environment variable using one of the above methods.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        Open a terminal and run:

        ```sh
        defaults read com.roblox.RobloxStudioBrowser
        ```

        Look in the output for a key called `roblox\\U00b7com.\\U00b7ROBLOSECURITY`, then look for the text in the
        format `COOK::<value>`. Copy the `value` part (not including the `<`/`>`). This is your `.ROBLOSECURITY`
        cookie. You can then set your environment variable using one of the above methods.
    </Tab>

## Remote state management

Mantle supports managing remote state files using AWS S3 storage which requires authentication. You can
provide your credentials either through environment variables or [an AWS profile
file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-profiles.html#cli-configure-profiles-create).

If you are new to using AWS, I recommend you read their guide on [best practices for managing AWS
access keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html)
before getting started.

To learn how to get an access key ID and secret, you can read their guide on [understanding and
getting your AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html)
(read the intro and "Programmatic access" sections).

The simplest method is to set the `MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment
variables. Mantle also supports the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` variables but recommends
you scope your variables to Mantle to avoid conflicts with other tools.

If you're using Mantle within an AWS EC2 instance or AWS Elastic Container Service, you can set the
`MANTLE_AWS_INHERIT_IAM_ROLE` environment variable to `true` to inherit the permission set granted to the host
runner via either the EC2 instance's IAM role or the Elastic Container Service task execution IAM role.

You can set your environment variables in various ways, like the following:

<Tabs items={["dotenv file", "Windows (PowerShell)", "MacOS/Linux (Bash)"]}>
    <Tab>
        Create a `.env` file with the contents:

        ```shell
        MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="{your access key id}"
        MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="{your secret access key}"
        ```

        [Learn more →](#dotenv-files)
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```ps1
        $env:MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "{your access key id}"
        $env:MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "{your secret access key}"
        ```

        Note that these will be temporary and you will have to reset them whenever you start a new terminal
        instance.
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
        ```bash
        export MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = "{your access key id}"
        export MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "{your secret access key}"
        ```

        Note that these will be temporary and you will have to reset them whenever you start a new terminal
        instance.

## `dotenv` files

`dotenv` files are a common tool in the industry for storing frequently used environment variables on a
per-developer basis. It is important to make sure you do not check-in your `dotenv` files into your SCM repo.

When a `dotenv` file is present in the current working directory or any of its parents, Mantle will parse its
contents and use the provided variable definitions as environment variables.

To create a `dotenv` file, start by ensuring it will be ignored by your SCM tool. For Git, create or update
your `.gitignore` file:

```shell filename=".gitignore"
# ignore all dotenv files
.env
```

Now create a file with the name `.env` in your project, and add any variables you want Mantle to load:

```shell filename=".env"
VARIABLE_NAME="{value}"
```

It's good practice to update your `README.md` or `CONTRIBUTING.md` file as well so that other developers on
your team know they need to create a `.env` file themselves and add the necessary variables, for example:

````md filename="README.md"
## Contributing

After cloning the repo, create a `.env` file in the root of the project, and add the following variables:

```
MANTLE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="{your access key id}"
MANTLE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="{your secret access key}"
```

You can get the secrets by...
````
